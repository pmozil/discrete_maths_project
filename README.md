# discrete_maths_project report

## Project structure
The project itself consists of only one file - `two_sat.py`

The file consists of four functions:
- `read_csv` - reads the csv into a graph
- `write_csv` - writes a grph to csv
- `colour_graph` - returns either a recoloured graph or nothing, if the graph does not exist

**Because there are only three functions, @pmozil proposes that there be 
multiple `colour_graph functions**

Here's the distribution of work:
    - `read_csv` **(author here)**
    - `write_csv` **(author here)**
    - `colour_graph` **(author here)**
